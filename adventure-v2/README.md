# adventure-v2

Planned v2 runtime for benchmark-oriented adventure orchestration.

## Scope in this phase

- Documentation and scaffold definition only.
- No executable runtime code yet.

## Planned structure

```text
adventure-v2/
  apps/
    web/
    server/
  packages/
    contracts/
    cognition/
    control/
  docs/
```

## Package responsibilities

- `apps/web`: terminal-style UI and actor/state observability panes.
- `apps/server`: run/session APIs, oracle bridge, event streaming.
- `packages/contracts`: shared schemas for events, reconcile, checkpoints, APIs.
- `packages/cognition`: LangGraph orchestration and reconcile pipeline.
- `packages/control`: XState loop-control machine and telemetry policy.
- `docs`: package-local docs that reference root architecture/ADR docs.

## Model surface (planned)

- `SLM`: smaller local language models for low-latency benchmark runs.
- `LLM`: larger hosted language models for quality-oriented benchmark runs.
- `API`: provider-backed model access through typed server-side integrations.
- `MLX`: local Apple Silicon execution path for on-device model experiments.

## Bootstrap plan

1. Define workspace/package manifests.
2. Add Cucumber-style behavior features (Gherkin) plus schema-first contract tests.
3. Add minimal server run lifecycle with synthetic fixtures.
4. Add web shell with transcript + state panel placeholders.
5. Wire cognition/control packages behind stable contracts.

## Testing principles

- Use Cucumber-style BDD as the acceptance layer and TDD as the implementation loop.
- Keep feature files focused on observable benchmark behaviors (replay, drift, loop transitions).
- Map each feature to deterministic fixtures and typed step helpers.
